POSSIBLE METHODS FOR ADDING TO AUTOSTART
https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/19.html

a way to change the signature would also be useful

M1: - add to "run once" regKey execution
	- duplicate to different folder with different name
M2: - use schtasks to shedule on login execution
	- duplicate to different folder and transfer control to copy
	- copy should delete old (exe and schtasks) and readd the schedule
M3, hard to implement, will result in huge exe, not guaranteed to work, possibly detected:
	- find autostart executable
	- copy binary and inject with malcode
	- replace original with injected binary
M4: - copy to different folder
	- add link to copy in autostart folder
	- remove old link from autostart
M5, will result in SYSTEM access, high chance of detection without system level exploit:
	- follow "WMI Permanent Event Subscription // Managed Object Formats (MOF)" on link above for instruction

IDEA:
with M1, M2, M4 implemented

- EXE with parameters
	run: will execute the keylogger
	copy: will create copy of exe
	persistence#: will trigger persistence adding technique #
- steps of COPY:
	parent:
		1) generate new folder and file name (!only the names, no actions on disk)
		2) copy itself into the tmp directory
		3) execute the file in tmp, pass generated names in
	tmp child:
		1) create folder and generate new exe (possibly modify signature) with new name in that folder
		2) exit
	parent:
		4) on exit of "tmp child" check if folder and filename exist
			exist: goto parent#5
			else: TBD
		5) execute child with persistence#
		6) check if child still exists
			exists: execute child.run
			else: goto parent#1 and use different persistence technique at step parent#5
